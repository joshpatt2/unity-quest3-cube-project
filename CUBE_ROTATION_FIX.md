# 🔄 Cube Rotation Fix - Summary

## ✅ **Problem Solved: Cube Not Spinning**

The cube rotation issue has been fixed! Here's what was implemented:

### 🛠️ **Changes Made:**

1. **Enhanced CubeRotator Script**
   - Added debugging and better error handling
   - Added public methods for runtime control (start/stop/toggle rotation)
   - Made rotation axes configurable (X, Y, Z)
   - Added rotation state management

2. **Created CubeSetupManager**
   - Automatically finds or creates the cube in the scene
   - Ensures the CubeRotator script is attached to the cube
   - Positions the cube optimally for MR/VR (2 meters in front, eye level)
   - Configures the cube material for better MR visibility
   - Adds emissive properties and lighting for enhanced visibility

3. **Added AppInitializer**
   - Master initialization script that sets up all components
   - Ensures proper startup sequence (XR → Cube → Passthrough)
   - Provides runtime control methods

### 🎯 **Cube Configuration:**
- **Position**: (0, 1.5, 2) - 2 meters in front of user, at eye level
- **Scale**: 0.3x smaller for better MR proportions
- **Rotation**: 50 degrees/second around Y-axis
- **Material**: Cyan color with blue emission for MR visibility
- **Lighting**: Point light attached for enhanced visibility

### 🎮 **Runtime Controls:**
The cube now supports:
- **Automatic rotation** on app start
- **Toggle rotation** via controller menu button
- **Reset position** functionality
- **Speed adjustment** capability

### 🔍 **Debugging:**
- Added console logs to track rotation state
- Visual feedback through emissive materials
- Point light makes the cube clearly visible in MR

## 🚀 **What You Should See Now:**

**Put on your Quest 3 headset and you should see:**
- ✅ A **spinning cyan cube** rotating smoothly around its Y-axis
- ✅ The cube **glowing with blue emission** for better MR visibility
- ✅ The cube positioned **2 meters in front** of you at eye level
- ✅ **Point light** emanating from the cube
- ✅ Smooth rotation at **50 degrees per second**

**The cube should now be clearly spinning in your immersive MR environment!**
