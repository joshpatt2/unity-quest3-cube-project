# Quest 3 Immersive Mixed Reality App - Usage Guide

## 🥽 What Changed

Your app has been converted from a 2D app to a **fully immersive Mixed Reality experience** that should now:

- ✅ Launch in immersive VR/MR mode (not as a 2D window)
- ✅ Track your head movement in 3D space
- ✅ Display virtual objects in your real environment (passthrough mode)
- ✅ Support hand tracking and controller input

## 🎮 Controls

### XR Controller Controls:
- **Menu Button**: Toggle between VR mode and MR (passthrough) mode
- **Trigger**: Interact with the virtual cube (changes color)
- **Grip**: Reset cube position

### Hand Tracking:
- Point and pinch to interact with virtual objects
- Hand movements are tracked in 3D space

## 🔧 Key Features Added

### 1. **XR Initialization System**
- `XRImmersiveInitializer.cs` - Ensures the app starts in immersive mode
- Automatically initializes XR subsystems on startup
- Configures room-scale or seated tracking

### 2. **Mixed Reality Support**
- `Quest3PassthroughManager.cs` - Handles passthrough/MR mode
- Real-world environment blending with virtual objects
- Automatic lighting adjustment for MR

### 3. **Enhanced Android Manifest**
- Proper VR application declaration
- Passthrough permissions
- Hand tracking support
- Immersive activity configuration

### 4. **XR-Optimized Build Settings**
- IL2CPP scripting backend for Quest performance
- ARM64 architecture targeting
- Android XR loader configuration
- Stereo rendering optimization

## 🚀 Testing the Immersive Experience

1. **Put on your Quest 3 headset**
2. **Look for "Quest3CubeProject" in your apps**
3. **Launch the app** - it should now start in immersive mode
4. **You should see:**
   - A 3D virtual cube floating in your real environment
   - Your real surroundings visible through passthrough
   - Hand/controller tracking working
   - Ability to interact with the cube in 3D space

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If the app still appears as 2D:
1. Check that "Unknown Sources" is enabled in Quest settings
2. Ensure the app has camera permissions for passthrough
3. Try restarting the app
4. Check the Unity console logs via `adb logcat`

## 📱 Development Notes

The app now includes:
- Proper XR initialization on startup
- Android VR application manifest
- Mixed Reality environment configuration
- Cross-platform XR input handling
- Optimized rendering for Quest 3

**The app should now be a true immersive XR experience rather than a 2D application!**
