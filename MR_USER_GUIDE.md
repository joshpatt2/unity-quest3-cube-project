## How to Use

1. **Put on your Quest 3 headset**
2. **Launch the Quest3CubeProject app**
3. **The app starts in MR mode by default** - you should see your real environment with a virtual cube floating in front of you
4. **Press the Menu button** on your controller to toggle between:
   - **MR Mode**: See your real environment + virtual cube
   - **VR Mode**: Traditional black/skybox background + virtual cube

## MR vs VR Mode

### Mixed Reality Mode (Default)

## Troubleshooting

### If you don't see passthrough:
1. Make sure your Quest 3 has passthrough enabled in system settings
2. Check that the app has camera permissions
3. Try toggling between VR/MR mode using the Menu button

### If the cube appears too close/far:
- The cube is positioned 2 meters away by default
